                    <p>
                        Involves cleaning the data - i.e. removing NA values
                        standardising the data - converting all values to some std values , mean = 0 std deviation = 1
                        feature scaling - to avoid errors like 3000m > 5km , scaling all values between 1 and 0
                        label encoding - converting string values to unique numbers for easy visualisations and calculation
